Welcome to my digital garden! 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer working remotely at [Panther Labs](https://runpanther.io/). I'm a "fullstack engineer" but I consider myself a specialist in the front-end web space. I primarily work with React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

This space is my personal corner of the internet. I consider it more of a [digital garden](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/) than I do a blog. That means that sometimes I'll write stuff that's half-baked as _I'm_ learning and developing. I think it's more important to do this in public than it is to hoard draft versions of posts.

If you're looking to reach me feel free to reach out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/benjamminj).

Thanks for stopping in!
