## Trying something new ðŸ§ª

I'm gonna try writing some of these smaller updates on a (hopefully) monthly basis. With new responsibilities (more on that coming soon!) I've found that I have less and less time to write here.

That said, I'm not gonna hold myself strictly to a monthly cadence. The goal is to keep my writing skills fresh. Sometimes life happens and the website won't be updated, and that's ok.

Fingers crossed that I'll be able to write more frequently in smaller bursts.

## New family member ðŸ‘¶

The most important event in my family's March 2022 calendarâ€”on March 19 my wife and I welcomed Ian to our family! We love this little guy so much and have been cherishing every single moment since his arrival.

I've been on parental leave since, and _absolutely loving it_. I'm incredibly grateful to [Panther Labs](https://panther.com) for giving me this time to spend bonding with my family and adjusting to my new job as Dad.

## Stuff I've been learning ðŸ¤“

- Been playing around with [Remix](https://remix.run/) quite a bit lately, and loving it. I'm especially fond of the focus on _fundamentals_ and _simplicity_. It feels like a breath of fresh air in the midst of a whirlwind of complexity.
- Just finished reading [Kill it with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire) by Marianne Bellotti. I highly recommend it, especially if you work on any software that needs to live more than a couple months.
- Per the above announcement, most of my energy has gone into learning my new role as Dad, and adjusting to life as a new parent ðŸ’•
