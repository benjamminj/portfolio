  ## The Challenge

  RetailCo's legacy e-commerce platform was suffering from:

  - 3.5s+ load times on mobile devices
  - 23% cart abandonment rate
  - Poor accessibility scores (68/100)
  - Outdated visual design from 2018

  My team was tasked with redesigning the entire customer journey while maintaining all existing functionality and improving core metrics.

  ## Solution Architecture

  I led the frontend architecture redesign, implementing:

  - React 18 with Server Components
  - GraphQL federation across microservices
  - Edge-optimized CDN distribution
  - Progressive image loading
  - Service worker-based caching strategy

  This combination allowed us to serve critical content in under 800ms while maintaining SEO requirements.

  ## Technical Challenges

  The biggest hurdle was migrating the existing checkout flow without disrupting ongoing transactions.

  I developed a staged rollout strategy using feature flags that allowed:

  - A/B testing between old and new UI
  - Gradual customer migration based on cohorts
  - Automated fallback to legacy system on errors
  - Real-time monitoring dashboards for the team

  ## Impact & Results

  The redesign exceeded all target metrics:

  - Page load time: 3.5s → 0.8s (77% improvement)
  - Mobile conversion: +15% 
  - Cart abandonment: 23% → 14%
  - Lighthouse performance: 62 → 94
  - Accessibility score: 68 → 97

  Most importantly, the architecture is now scalable for the upcoming international expansion planned for Q3.
