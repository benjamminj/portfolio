Hi! Thanks for reading my little corner of the internet.

I build large scale frontend web applications, specifically with an eye towards progressive enhancement, accessibility, and simplicity. I currently work as a principal frontend engineer at [Panther Labs](https://panther.com/).

I'm currently based out of the greater Seattle area where my family and I love the wet winters and beautiful PNW summers.

Wanna connect? Reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjamminj) or shoot me an [email](mailto:benjamin.d.johnson@icloud.com), I'd love to hear from you.
