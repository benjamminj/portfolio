## Declaring variables

```php
$variable = 'value';
```

## Object operator (`->`)

```php
// Create an object
$obj = new stdClass();

// Set a property on an object
$obj->prop = 'test';

// Get a property on an object
$prop = $obj->prop;
print( $prop ); // test

// Call a method on an object
$obj->method();
```

## "Arrays"

PHP arrays are _very_ different than JavaScript arrays. They're more similar to JavaScript _objects_, even though they use the square bracket syntax.

```php
$arr = [
  'key1' => 'val', // the => assigns the value to the key
  'key2' => 'val2'
];
```

The equivalent JS code would be something like this:

```js
const arr = {
  key1: 'val',
  key2: 'val2',
}
```

In addition, you _can_ use a PHP `array` as a sorted, unkeyed list (similar to a JS array), in that case you would use the array syntax _without_ the key syntax

```php
$arr = [
  'val', // key is 0
  'val2' // key is 1
];
```

To access an array value, you can use the square brackets along with the key name:

```php
$arr['key'];
```
