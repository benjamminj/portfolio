## Why is a programming benchmark useful?

<Callout variant="warning">WIP</Callout>

- Lets you compare methods of solving the same problem.
- Allows you to focus on the _mechanics_ of a language or framework.
- Allows you to work within a _domain_ that you're already familiar with.

## Existing programming benchmarks

### [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)

This is perhaps the most well-known full-stack benchmark out there. TodoMVC is great if you're trying to get familiar with a language or framework. However, it should be viewed as an "intro" to a framework rather than a comprehensive benchmark capable of highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

### [Hacker News PWA](https://hnpwa.com/)

Hacker News PWA is another common benchmark you'll see in the wild. It markets itself as a "spiritual successor to TodoMVC"â€”it's more complex and focuses on more modern technologies, especially progressive web apps.

### [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)

7GUIs is set of 7 exercises ranging from trivial (counter) to complex (spreadsheet). After you've done all 7 you should have a good feel for a language or framework. The only caveat (for me) is that it doesn't address some modern development challenges like data fetching (which has been [acknowledged by its creator](https://hackernoon.com/towards-a-better-gui-programming-benchmark-397aca3542b8), Eugen Kiss)

## My own programming benchmarks

Here's a few benchmarks I've used in the past when I'm exploring a framework or language.

### Simple counter

Usually the first thing I build after learning the basic syntax of a framework is a simple counter.

These are the "acceptance criteria" for the counter benchmark:

- The counter should display its current count and begin at 0.
- The counter has three controls: `+`, `-`, and `Reset`.
  - `+` adds 1 to the counter.
  - `-` removes 1 from the counter. If the counter is already at `0`, `-` should do nothing (or be disabled).
  - `Reset` sets the counter to `0`.

What I like about the counter as a first benchmark is it is _very limited in scope_. This makes it great for a first foray into a new language or framework. This allows you to grow familiar with the basic syntax, simple state management, and simple rendering.
