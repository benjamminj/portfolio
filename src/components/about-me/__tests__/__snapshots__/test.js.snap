<div class="jsx-2744509581 jsx-2744509581 AboutMe">
  <p class="jsx-2744509581">Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a musician-turned-frontend-dev based out of the greater
    Los Angeles area. I sometimes make things with code (ok actually, I do
    that all the time). Working as a frontend dev means that I am constantly
    evaluating the latest and greatest trends in web development for their
    usability, scalability, &amp; ability to provide real-world solutions (as
    well as the number of emojis in their readme 😎).</p>
  <p class="jsx-2744509581">Currently I'm working at a
    <a href="https://www.autogravity.com/" target="_blank"
    class="jsx-3226047878 jsx-3226047878 A">fintech startup in Irvine</a>to make the car-buying/financing process
    as simple as it can be using the power of the mobile web.</p>
  <p class="jsx-2744509581">In addition to working as a frontend developer, I like to give back to
    my community. I occasionally do workshops for students learning to code,
    and try to write some articles here and there (in between everything else!).</p>
