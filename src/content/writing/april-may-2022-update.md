April & May have been quite busy, but figured I'd drop a quick update on what I've been up to.

## Full-time parenting üê£

I spent all of April & May on parental leave. And boy, did we need it!

Being a parent is _not_ easy, but it is ‚ú® _so_ ‚ú® rewarding. I'm very grateful to my employer for these 10 weeks of time to spend caring for my wife and son. I don't know what we would have done without it.

## Principal engineer! üßë‚Äçüíª

I did get one work call while on leave. I've been promoted from Staff Engineer to Principal Engineer at [Panther](https://panther.com/)! I'm looking forward to exploring what this means in practice as I return from leave and continuing to build delightful frontend security workflows.

## Misc. updates ü§ì

- Been playing **much more** with [Remix](https://remix.run/) and I can firmly say I'm excited about it.
- I rewrote this website in Remix, and saw things become much simpler as a result! Win-win!
- Been reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) by Martin Kleppmann. While I'm more of a frontend specialist, I do regularly find myself working on distributed systems and collaborating with backend engineers. It's been a fascinating, in-depth look into what distributed systems have to deal with.
- It's been an unusually wet spring in the PNW, so I haven't got to spend as much time outdoors as I expected. But I'm excited for the summer months when we'll be able to spend some time outdoors!
