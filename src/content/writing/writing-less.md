I'm writing less these days. 

For the past few years, I've felt guilty about writing fewer blog posts. Earlier in my career, I published ~monthly; now it's more sporadic.

Frankly, I have less gas in the tank to spend on writing. Back in 2020, I had a major burnout that left me unable to even write code for a while. Fast forward to today—I have 2 young children, and I'd rather spend my limited time with my family than on another unfinished post.

Plus, the things I want to write about are trickier: deep technical dives, philosophical musings about software development, and real-world stories. All of these require more thought than a simple tutorial. Pair that with my post-burnout energy and finishing posts feels like a heavy lift.

Finally, this website’s former design didn’t inspire me to write. I know "rewrite your portfolio" is a bit of an engineer trope, but this latest iteration makes me want to finish (or restart) some of those drafts.

It’s tempting to compare yourself to other writers, especially more prolific ones. But it's not healthy. We each have an amount we can give, and mine is smaller than it used to be.

I'm writing less these days, and I'm ok with that. I'm learning to be easier on myself, slowly prune thoughts into posts, and write in smaller bursts.
