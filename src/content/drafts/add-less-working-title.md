Raw notes:

- "websites start fast until you add things to make them slow" (Cassidy Williams)
- the challenge is knowing when you need to do less and when you actually need "more"
  - it's easy to be idealistic or dogmatic about how we build things without taking the
    full context into account:
    - what timeline are you working on, and is it a "hard" or "soft" timeline?
    - will adding "more" help the bottom line? (aka the business needs customers)
    - will you need "more" in the near- or far-term future?
