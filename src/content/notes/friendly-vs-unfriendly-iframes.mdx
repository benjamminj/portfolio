### Definition

A **friendly `iframe`** has the same domain as its parent document.

In contrast, an **unfriendly `iframe`** has a different `src` domain than its parent.

### Differences

The key difference between friendly and unfriendly `iframe`s boils down to the level of access afforded by the embedded document.

In a friendly `iframe`, the embedded document has access to the parent's `window` object and can change things in the parent.

However, an unfriendly `iframe` is bound by `same-origin policy` and does _not_ have access to the parent document's `window` object.

### Why does it matter?

The primary reason that an `iframe` is more restricted if it comes from another domain is _security_. That `iframe` comes from a domain that you "don't control". Even if you actually _do_ control the domainâ€”there's no way of letting the browser know that.

And if you _are_ iframing a site that you don't own, it's possible that the external site gets hacked, or introduces some invasive code. If they had access to your site's `window` object you've suddenly also been hacked! ðŸ˜±

This means that your "hostile" `iframe`s can only talk to their parent document via [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage). This builds security into the cross-site communication since the parent document has to explicitly listen for and interprest the message sent from the `iframe`.
