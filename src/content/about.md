Thanks for popping into my little corner of the internet.

I build large scale frontend web applications, specifically with an eye towards progressive enhancement, accessibility, and simplicity. I currently work as a software engineer at [Sublime Security](https://sublimesecurity.com/).

I'm currently based out of the greater Seattle area where my family and I love the wet winters and beautiful PNW summers.

Wanna connect? Reach out on [Bluesky](/links/bluesky) or shoot me an [email](/links/email), I'd love to hear from you.
