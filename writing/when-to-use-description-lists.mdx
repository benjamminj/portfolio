- An unfortunate name: "definition list"
  - This has led to the sentiment that you should only use `dl` / `dt` / `dd` for terms and definitions.
  - However, the HTML spec itself allows much broader usage of `dl`
- What the HTML spec says about `dl`
  - "Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name-value data." [source](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-dl-element)
  - The HTML5 spec calls it a "description list" or an "association list"
- When to use description lists
  - When you have any set of "paired" data (key-value, name-definition, Q&A). Honestly, this element is _way_ more versatile than people think.
  - If the `dt` keys are not headers within your app â€” a `dl` does not permit heading / sectioning content within `dt` elements. However, all flow content is permitted within `dd` elements.
