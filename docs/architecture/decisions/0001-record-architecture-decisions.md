# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-09-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

Even though this project is mainly a 1 engineer side-project, recording architectural decisions allows using the records as a reminder of the "state of mind" we were in when making a decision, as well as the motivations behind it.

Additionally, it's a good engineering practice that would be nice to try out, and this blog is a great "guinea pig" for this approach.

See this article on [GitHub's engineering blog](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/) for some addition reasons why they could be a good practice.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs from here on out will be written in the first-person **singular** tense, since it's mainly just me building the app.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
