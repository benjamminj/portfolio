## Installation

If you're on a Mac (usually the case for me), you can install Redis via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew install redis
```

## Starting the server

You can start the server in a background process with `brew services`:

```bash
brew services start redis
```

```bash
brew services stop redis
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to run Redis in the background, you can use the `redis-server` to start Redis:

```bash
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```
