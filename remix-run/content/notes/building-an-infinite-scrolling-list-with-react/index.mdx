## Intro

### Do you _need_ an infinite list?

### List virtualization and "windowing"

### Why build it from scratch instead of {insert library here}?

- Small, focused bundle size
- Ability to customize and tweak to fit your needs.
  - for example, if you want to allow the list to change the height of the window. (or to have it NOT change the height of the window).
- Support for _pages_ of items and _grids_. This is a big one for the infinite lists I've built in the past. Most virtualization libraries supply the tools to do 1-dimensional lists fairly easily, or they allow virtualizing on both the x- and y-axis. So, doing a virtualized y-axis with a grid of items on the x-axis results in a lot of effort, equal to building the whole dang virtualized list yourself.
- Deep knowledge of list virtualization. If you're building web apps, it's a good thing to know, and allows you to wow clients (or product managers) while still providing a good user experience.

### Creating a good infinite scroll experience

- ability to handle any number of items with smooth framerates while scrolling
- ability to "load more" when the bottom of the list is reached
- scroll scrubbing with lazy-loading
- smaller bundle size than `react-window` (granted, it will also have a smaller feature set)
- does not overflow or have weird spacing at the bottom of the list.
- allows us to handle responsive sizing in _some_ fashion.

## Let's build it!

### Set up the shell of our list

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export interface VirtualizedListProps {
  total: number
  rowHeight: number
}

export const VirtualizedList = ({ total, rowHeight }: VirtualizedListProps) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: '#eee',
        height: rowHeight * total,
      }}
    ></div>
  )
}
```

- inline styles for simplicity
- light gray as "background" for now
- we add 2 props to our list
  - the total count of items we plan on rendering
  - the height of each individual row. For now we're assuming that each row contains 1 item.
- Finally, we use the count of total items and the height of each individual row to get the full height of our list.

### Split our total count of items into "pages"

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export interface VirtualizedListProps {
  total: number
  rowHeight: number
  pageSize: number
}

export const VirtualizedList = ({
  total,
  rowHeight,
  pageSize,
}: VirtualizedListProps) => {
  const pages = Math.ceil(total / pageSize)
  const pageHeight = pageSize * rowHeight
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: '#eee',
        height: pageHeight * pages,
      }}
    ></div>
  )
}
```

- Add 1 more prop, now the amount of items in a "page".
- Now, instead of calculating by the number of rows, we'll be calculating the total height by the number of "pages". Right now we only are rendering 1 item per row so the calculation will be fairly straightforward.

### Fix the last page

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type GetLastPageHeight = (args: {
  total: number
  pageSize: number
  rowHeight: number
}) => number

const getLastPageHeight: GetLastPageHeight = ({
  total,
  pageSize,
  rowHeight,
}) => {
  const pages = total / pageSize
  const completePages = Math.floor(pages)

  if (completePages === pages) {
    return pageSize * rowHeight
  }

  const lastPageStartIndex = completePages * pageSize - 1
  const itemsOnLastPage = total - lastPageStartIndex - 1

  return itemsOnLastPage * rowHeight
}

export interface VirtualizedListProps {
  total: number
  rowHeight: number
  pageSize: number
}

export const VirtualizedList = ({
  total,
  rowHeight,
  pageSize,
}: VirtualizedListProps) => {
  const pages = Math.ceil(total / pageSize)
  const pageHeight = pageSize * rowHeight
  const lastPageStartIndex = pages - 1
  const lastPageHeight = getLastPageHeight({
    total,
    rowHeight,
    pageSize,
  })
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: '#eee',
        height: pageHeight * lastPageStartIndex + lastPageHeight,
      }}
    ></div>
  )
}
```

- the list works great if the number of items evenly divides by the page size, but if it _doesn't_ we're left with some extra space at the bottom of the list. To get the height to be _exactly_ the number of items, we need to add some calculation for the final page of items.
- we calculate how many complete pages exist, if that's the same as the total # of pages, then our calculation is more straightforward. Otherwise, we have to do a little extra math to figure out how many rows exist on the final page.

### Add the ability to render a custom page of items

```tsx
import React, { Fragment, ReactNode } from 'react'

type GetLastPageHeight = (args: {
  total: number
  pageSize: number
  rowHeight: number
}) => number

const getLastPageHeight: GetLastPageHeight = ({
  total,
  pageSize,
  rowHeight,
}) => {
  const pages = total / pageSize
  const completePages = Math.floor(pages)

  if (completePages === pages) {
    return pageSize * rowHeight
  }

  const lastPageStartIndex = completePages * pageSize - 1
  const itemsOnLastPage = total - lastPageStartIndex - 1

  return itemsOnLastPage * rowHeight
}

export interface VirtualizedListProps {
  total: number
  rowHeight: number
  pageSize: number
  renderPage: (index: number) => ReactNode
}

export const VirtualizedList = ({
  total,
  rowHeight,
  pageSize,
  renderPage,
}: VirtualizedListProps) => {
  const pages = Math.ceil(total / pageSize)
  const pageHeight = pageSize * rowHeight
  const lastPageStartIndex = pages - 1
  const lastPageHeight = getLastPageHeight({
    total,
    rowHeight,
    pageSize,
  })
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: '#eee',
        height: pageHeight * lastPageStartIndex + lastPageHeight,
      }}
    >
      {Array.from({ length: pages }).map((_, index) => (
        <div
          key={index}
          style={{
            height: index === lastPageStartIndex ? lastPageHeight : pageHeight,
          }}
        >
          {renderPage(index)}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

### Some next steps

- Allow dynamically determining a page's size. In `react-window` this is called `VariableSizedList`
