## Trying something new ðŸ§ª

I'm gonna try writing some of these smaller updates on a (hopefully) monthly basis. With new responsibilities (more on that coming soon!) I've found that I have less and less time to write here.

That said, I'm not gonna beat myself up if I miss an update. Sometimes life happens and the website won't be updated, and that's ok.

## New family member ðŸ‘¶

On March 19 my wife and I welcomed Ian to our family! We love this little guy so much and have cherished each sleep-deprived moment since his arrival.

I've been on parental leave since, and am _loving it_. I'm incredibly grateful to [Panther Labs](https://panther.com) for this time to bond with my family and adjust to my new job as Dad.

## Miscellaneous updates ðŸ¤“

- Been playing with [Remix](https://remix.run/) quite a bit lately, and loving it. I'm especially fond of the focus on _fundamentals_ and _simplicity_. It certainly feels like a breath of fresh air.
- Just finished reading [Kill it with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire) by Marianne Bellotti. I highly recommend it, especially if you work on any software that needs to live more than a couple months.
- Per the above announcement, most of my energy has gone into learning my new role as Dad, and adjusting to life as a new parent ðŸ’•
