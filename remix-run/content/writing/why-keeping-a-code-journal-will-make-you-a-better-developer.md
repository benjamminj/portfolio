Iâ€™ll be honestâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI straight-up stole this idea from [Ryan McDermott](https://medium.com/@ryansworks) after hearing him talk about keeping a code journal on [JS Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/clean-code-javascript-with-ryan-mcdermott) and how it helped him write better code over time.

Over the past 3â€“4 months Iâ€™ve been keeping a code journal of my own, and I can personally vouch for the benefits that come from taking a couple minutes to reflect on the code I read/wrote. Like any habit, it takes some time to form, especially when youâ€™ve got real work to doâ€Šâ€”â€Šand I still miss days here and there. But I wanted to share a few of the benefits that Iâ€™ve noticed.

## Keeping a Code Journal Forces You to Identify Code Smells.

Itâ€™s truly rare to see a perfect codebase. If youâ€™re working as a developer, chances are youâ€™re spending most of your day reading code, and thereâ€™s bound to be something the code you read thatâ€™s less than perfect.

Most of the time, if itâ€™s something that super hard to understand, you either spend a couple extra minutes reading/understanding the code, or you go and ask the developer who wrote it.

And then you go about solving the problem you were working on, and in a few weeks, you more or less forgot about the smelly code you read on that one occasion (after all, youâ€™re on to something completely else by then).

Furthermore, sometimes you know intuitively that something isnâ€™t clean or easy to read, but youâ€™re not exactly sure why.

Both of these scenarios are a perfect case for keeping a code journal. By virtue of documenting what you read youâ€™re forced to process why it was less than ideal (this has the side benefit of also exposing good alternatives), and you now have a written record that you can reference later. Win-Win.

## Keeping a Code Journal Helps You Identify Clean Code.

Your reflections shouldnâ€™t be all negativity though. Chances are you work with a bunch of smart people (I know I do!) that are capable of writing beautiful, clean, readable code.

Just like when noting code smells, sometimes you donâ€™t intuitively know why the code you read is amazing, and chances are youâ€™re not gonna remember it in a few weeks. Taking the time to process what was great about it will help you internalize the concepts.

## Keeping a Code Journal Helps You With Personal Branding.

One of the awesome side effects of writing down all of the clean/messy code you read is that youâ€™re basically writing outlines for blog posts. If youâ€™re anything like me, consistency and finding good material to write on are two of the hardest things.

Iâ€™ll be honest, consistency with writing hasnâ€™t been my strong suit, and Iâ€™m not gonna dive into that right now ðŸ˜Ž. Keeping a code journal isnâ€™t going to help you sit down and actually write articles. Thatâ€™s more on the discipline side of things.

However, keeping a code journal can help with inspiration. Think of it this wayâ€”if you write down one entry every other day (see, even not that consistently!), at the end of a week youâ€™d have 3â€“4 ideas that you can look at for inspiration. And furthermore, youâ€™ve already written a basic outline.

## Conclusion

Even if youâ€™re not writing entries frequently, reflection is one of the best ways to internalize the things that you learn.

Another thing to note. Iâ€™ve just been using a git repo with a bunch of markdown files. I find it really easy to go write something down and get back to work this way. But you donâ€™t have to do it the way that I doâ€Šâ€”â€Šdo whatever helps you best!

What about you? Are there any specific things that you do to internalize the things that you encounter in your day-to-day learning?
