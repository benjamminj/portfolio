One of my favorite CSS "tricks" is the `rem`-based media query:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 48rem) {
  /*  Styles for tablets and above */
}
```

Instead of using pixels for the width of the screen, you can define the width of the screen using `rem` units. One key benefit to this is **accessibility**.

I often bump my font size up larger than the default. While I can see fine without it I find the larger font sizes relaxing on my eyes.

Writing media queries like this allows you to scale layout with a user's font-sizing preferences. So if your user has a tablet screen (~768px) and a 150% font size, they would see the _mobile_ layout. This mobile layout is more helpful if your font is taking up a significant portion of your tablet-sized screen width.

Lastly, a couple caveats to this approach. First, if you're actually changing the `font-size` on the `html` element, this might not be for you. Personally, I've never had to actually change the root `font-size` dynamically so this is rarely a concern for me.

Second, `rem`-based media queries can take a while to get used to. You'll have to do some math if you need to figure out standard screen sizes. For example, `768px` divided by a root font-size of `16` results in `48rem`. That said, I think the benefits (accessibility) outweigh the cost (unfamiliarity).
