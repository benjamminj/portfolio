# 5. Add Style Guides

Date: 2020-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Writing code can be messy, and there's a lot of trade-offs to consider. Especially on a project like this where it's a testing ground to try new techniques.

Furthermore, I want to make sure that I keep a consistent tone in my writing as I document my learning journey. This will help with remembering things from guiding principles to helpful writing tips.

## Decision

There will be a new folder of `docs/guidelines` that captures guiding principles. These guides should be living documents, not set in stone.

## Consequences

- I'll have to update these and flesh them out as I go.
- I'll have to actually follow them. ðŸ¤£
- If I ever had guest posters on this site, I would have a place to refer them to in regards to style.
