I'm trying a new thing! When I get a question more than a couple times, it goes into the backlog of articles I need to write! Sadly, this backlog grows longer every week, maybe someday I'll run out of article ideas! ðŸ˜±

As a grad of Thinkful, I often get asked about my experience there -- did I like it and was it worth the tuition? If you're considering Thinkful (or a bootcamp in general), I hope this article helps you as you consider some really large decisions about learning programming.

## tl;dr

Thinkful was a great choice for me at the time I attended -- it fit _what I needed_. But make sure it fits what _you_ need if you're considering attending there, everything I write here was 5 years ago!

## Why I attended Thinkful

It's really important to choose a learning path that suits _your_ needs. For me, Thinkful fit the bill for a few reasons:

- **Remote-first.** Thinkful is primarily a remote bootcamp, and I didn't want to be driving into in-person classes. Remote work was a big reason I was interested in getting into the software industry, even before COVID-19.
- **Affordable.** Thinkful was more affordable than the other bootcamps that I looked at, and their billing structure allowed me to finance it with a loan and pay it slowly. I couldn't afford to do a CS degree as I had just graduated with a music degree a few years earlier (also time, 4 years is a long time).
- **Part-time.** Thinkful had part-time (20h / week, 6 months) and a full-time (40h / week, 3 months) courses when I attended. Attending part-time allowed me to work as a valet and continue paying rent while I changed careers.
- **Self-paced with mentorship.** The program I attended was mostly self-paced -- you met 1-on-1 with a mentor 3x per week. Mentors were usually senior engineers working for Thinkful as a side-gig, so they had real industry experience.
- **Career services.** At the time, Thinkful offered a robust career services branch _after you graduated_. You met with a career mentor 1x per week, and if Thinkful couldn't place you in a full-time job/internship within 6 months they would refund your tuition. Lots of bootcamps offer this today, but back then it wasn't as common.

## My experience

Overall, I had a great experience at Thinkful! The self-paced curriculum paired with frequent lessons with my mentor worked well for me. Coming from a music background, learning to code felt like learning an instrument -- you had lessons with a teacher and homework to do between lessons.

Another thing that allowed me to learn deeply was taking the course at a part-time pace. I was only expected to do ~20 hours of work per week, but I probably ended up coding for ~30 hours per week. This gave me some extra time to get lost in rabbit holes and _be curious_ about the things I was learning (in retrospect, I blame my then-undiagnosed ADHD).

Finally, career services was critical to my job search. I graduated early (I joke that I dropped out) to take an internship that I had gotten through my network. That internship didn't pan out into the full-time opportunity I thought it would be, so I _went back to career services_. With a lot of valuable [lessons I learned in career services](/getting-your-first-software-engineering-job), I had a full-time offer 3-4 months later.
